## About
<br>react-with-swr is a project that was set up with vite and react. It is a pokemon database, which requests pokemone data, including name, type, and photo, from an api. This app is intended for educational purposes and safely requests data from an external site. Styling included to improve UI.
<br>App is also supposed to have music in the background. However, I was unable to make the audio run without breaking the application. I will cotninue working on this on the side to make sure that I know how to do this.
